# hello-world
This is a repository created to help me learn how to use github.

I hope to use github to collaborate to produce documents.
I would also like to use it to create a website for myself with links to my academic papers.
Finally, I might be able to use it to produce blog articles, prior to loading them up to LinkedIn.
